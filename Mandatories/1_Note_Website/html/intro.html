        <p>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment.
            <br>
            It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!
            <br><br>
            Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser.
            <br>
            This allows Node.js to be very performant.
            <br><br>
            A Node.js app is run in a single process, without creating a new thread for every request.
            <br>
            Node.js provides a set of asynchronous I/O primitives in its standard library that prevent JavaScript code from blocking and generally, libraries in Node.js are written using non-blocking paradigms, making blocking behavior the exception rather than the norm.
            <br><br>
            When Node.js performs an I/O operation, like reading from the network, accessing a database or the filesystem, instead of blocking the thread and wasting CPU cycles waiting, Node.js will resume the operations when the response comes back.
            <br><br>
            This allows Node.js to handle thousands of concurrent connections with a single server without introducing the burden of managing thread concurrency, which could be a significant source of bugs.
            <br>
            Node.js has a unique advantage because millions of frontend developers that write JavaScript for the browser are now able to write the server-side code in addition to the client-side code without the need to learn a completely different language.
            <br><br>
            In Node.js the new ECMAScript standards can be used without problems, as you don't have to wait for all your users to update their browsers - you are in charge of deciding which ECMAScript version to use by changing the Node.js version, and you can also enable specific experimental features by running Node.js with flags.
